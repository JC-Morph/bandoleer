# Bandoleer
### Turn your ruby files into ruby vials! (It's another container)

## Synopsis

Bandoleer is an IoC container focusing on the automatic extraction of constants from ruby files. Essentially it's a rather simple wrapper for the canister gem, adding helper methods to abstract boilerplate for a particular pattern of containering. It also uses medieval style rpg equip lingo, which helps you feel cool when writing basic code, if that's something you're into.

## Installation

%% Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

%%     $ bundle add bandoleer

%% If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

%%     $ gem install bandoleer


## Usage
